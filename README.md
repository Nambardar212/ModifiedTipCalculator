# ModifiedTipCalculator
Problem Statement

Whenever I go out to eat and I’m having a hard time calculating the right tip, I’ll
fumble with my phone and search for a “tip calculator” on Google. I couldn’t tell you
the name or the URL of the one I usually end up using, but it’s a simple JavaScript
app. So go ahead and take a swing at making your own tip calculator.

Functionality

1)The app should take 3 fields as input. They are the total bill, total number of people, and the percent of tip you want to give
2)After taking these input calculate the tip amount you need to give and also the amount of money that should be contributed by each person(considering everyone contributes equally)
